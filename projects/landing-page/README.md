## Description

This project is a simple landing page that demonstrates the use of JavaScript to manipulate the DOM. It also showcases responsive design techniques using HTML and CSS.

## Instructions

To get started, clone the project to your local machine and open the `index.html` file in your browser. You can also view a live demo [here]().

## Project Structure

The project contains the following files and folders:

```bash
landing-page/
├── README.md
├── index.html
├── css/
│   └── styles.css
└── js/
    └── app.js
```

- `README.md`: Contains the documentation for the project
- `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure of the landing page
- `css/`: Contains the CSS styles for the landing page
- `js/`: Contains the JavaScript code that dynamically creates the navigation menu, scrolls to the appropriate section, and highlights the section and corresponding link when in view.
